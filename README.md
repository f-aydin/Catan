# Catan
Basic and unfinished version of the board game the Settlers of Catan.

At the moment, it is possible to build settlements via input boxes on the back-end/db. It is also possible to distribute resources based on the location of your settlements and dice you have rolled.

## Usage
In the client directory, run:
```
npm start
```
Run this simultaneously with the Spring Application in /src.
